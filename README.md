# MO-GOMEA

Modified version of the official implementation (https://homepages.cwi.nl/~bosman/source_code.php)

I introduced the following changes:
1) using fitness functions written in Python. Note that it's not very general (i.e. restricted to my NAS use cases), but should be relatively easy to adapt to your use case; 
2) each variable can take more than 2 values, and different variables may have different alphabet sizes;
3) setting random seed to a specific value;
4) executing a precise (user-provided) amount of evaluations.

## How to compile

1) set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib64:path_to_conda_lib"`,
where `path_to_conda_lib` is something like `/export/scratch1/home/aleksand/miniconda3/envs/supernetevo/lib`
2) Set `LIBRARY_PATH` to `path_to_conda_lib` (which is the same as in the previous step)
3) In CMakeLists.txt change ``target_include_directories`` to refer to the header files of your Python distribution.

4) run
```
/usr/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" /export/scratch3/aleksand/MO_GOMEA/ -B/export/scratch3/aleksand/MO_GOMEA/cmake-build-release-remote
/usr/bin/cmake --build /export/scratch3/aleksand/MO_GOMEA/cmake-build-release-remote --target MO_GOMEA -- -j 6
```
where you should replace `/export/scratch3/aleksand/MO_GOMEA/` with the path to where you cloned the repo

## How to use

Refer to ENCAS repo, it has a Python interface to this executable. 

To be clear, the relationship with Python is bi-directional. 
1) Python code calls C executable to perform search, and gets the results from it.
2) Within the C executable, Python fitness functions are called.

For proper communication between Python and C, you need to set `PYTHONPATH`: `export PYTHONPATH=PATH_TO_ENCAS`,
where `PATH_TO_ENCAS` is the path where you cloned ENCAS (e.g. `"/export/scratch3/aleksand/encas"`)
